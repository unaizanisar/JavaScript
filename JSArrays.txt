JAVASCRIPT ARRAYS
In JS, everything is an object, so an array is also an object in js, (dot notation)

Why do we need arrays? 
For Example, if we want to store fruits:
let fruit1 = "apple"
let fruit2 = "banana"
.
.
.
let fruit5 = "mango"

Here, we declared and initialized one by one. This is not the efficient way. Arrays provide us the efficient way i.e declare and initialize one time and store the variables in it.
Array takes the contiguous memory location.
In above example, fruits are scattered at different memory locations, but using arrays, they are stored in contiguous memory locations. 
let fruits = ["apple","mango","orange"]
console.log(fruits) //this will call the array and print all the elements of the array!

But if we want to print only one fruit
Array indexing:
let fruits = {
    "0" : "apple",
    "1" : "mango",
    "2" : "orange"
}
console.log(fruits['2'])

Multi Type array:
let multiDyn = [
    "apple",
    {
        name = "banana",
        age = 2
    },
    "mango",
    {
        name="orange",
        age=3
    },
]

console.log(fruits.length)

INSERTION AND DELETION IN ARRAY:
fruits.push("grapes") //will insert the values at the end 

let lastElement = fruits.pop();
console.log(lastElement)

for start elements:
let firstElement = fruits.shift();
console.log(firstElement) //deleting elements from the start

unshift takes a parameter //add element to the start
fruits.unshift("kiwi")
console.log(fruits)

Insertion and Deletion at any index in an array is using splice and slice
