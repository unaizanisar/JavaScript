1. Forms:
You can have many buttons in a form, but submit button is only one.
-> user input means request, and from input means form control.

<form onsubmit = "submitValues()" return false> //return false to prevent reloading.
<input type = "text" value = 10>
<button type="button">Get Color</button>
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
 const submitValues = () => {
    try{
        const getValue =  document.getElementById('.input').value;
        console.log(getValue)
    } catch(error){
        console.log(error)
    }
 }

We have to use Asynchronous way.
Angular by default uses AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML)

Synchronous vs Asynchronous:
Synchronous means you can't do any other work, until one is completed.
Asynchronous means you do not need to wait/stop for the other tasks to be completed. (Node JS)

<form onsubmit = "submitValues()" return false formGroup> //this is a declarative way. Angular will make it non reloading by just using formGroup
<input type = "text" value = 10>
<button type="button">Get Color</button>
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

value is used with only html form tags and not with any other tag, so we use data-value

2. Debugger Tool:
To solve Logical Errors.
Element, Console, Source

3. JavaScript Regular Expressions:
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.
A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.
Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.
